            Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Form follows fucking function. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what.

            Fuck. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old.

            Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic.

            Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Learn from fucking criticism.

            The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Intuition is fucking important.

            If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. You are not your fucking work. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Use your fucking hands. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography.

            Fuck. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Learn from fucking criticism. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work.

            What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it.

            Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure.

While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.”

Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed.
